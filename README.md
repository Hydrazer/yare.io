# yare.io
This is my code for yare.io!
I am currently working on code for each unit type!
You can get starter code here -> intro_code.js

## Requirements

- node.js
- yarn (to install, do `npm i -g yarn`)

## Setup

Setup is super easy, just run `yarn install --production=false` in console.

You can now build your bot with `yarn build`

If you want to build for every save use the `-w` flag

If you want to autoupload (sync) your code to yare use the `-s`
